# Abstract
An CMOS Sensor is electronic chip that converts photons to electrons for digital processing. An Image Sensing Optical Receiver such as a CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) is made of Photodiode, Analog Circuits, Mixed Signal Circuits to amplify small photocurrents into digital signals. CMOS Sensors are used to create images in digital cameras, digital videos cameras and CCTV.

# Circuit Details
Several digital color sensors employ light to frequency technique and photodiodes, which is similar to other studies. These frequency – based digital sensors require an advanced processor, such as digital signal processor or personal computer to measure or calculate the frequency. Figure 1 shows an sensor. The time or duration of the ramp signal is: 
▲t = Cint * ▲V / Iphoto.

# Software Used
    * eSim Software
    It is an Open Source EDA developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay. It is used for electronic circuit simulation. It is made by the combination of two software namely     NgSpice and KiCAD.
